Day 10:
planned on writing a script for backing up my kde config and restoring to other pc's easy 
Worked on switching wallpaper on time 

Day 11:
Not worked much , cleaned some project details about kde backup and restore.

Day 12: 
created multiple scripts for backing up files and restoring them,a one time installation script that asks user what he would like to install or not.

Day 13:
completed kde restore and backup project with files and pushed it to github.

Day 14:
not a productive day but started with selenium and browser project,will have to create a project flow first clear cut to do then learn selenium for that task only.	

Day 15:
Learnt bit of selenium and created a script to get all the links of a page,based on yesterdays date.
Opens all the links in present browser.

Day 16:
Worked real hard today,learned bit selenium but completed the project with selenium.
Got the courses enroller script working for yesterdays courses.	took 9 hr,but don't have to do it manually again

Day 17:
Started learning maths for machine learning,lot of concepts in maths but only few are needed to understand Machine learning algorithms.

Day 18:
learnt about algebra,calculus definitions,gone through half of matrices concepts,matrices are calculations related to dimensionality,the number of rows equal to number of dimensions,so are basics for tabular data in machine learning

Day 19:
Completed matrices and their concpets but couldn't understand their uses in machine learning,will continue to see,where they will be used.

Day 20: 
Got doubts in matrices and their transformations but didn't find any good resources to understand so learnt from beginning again,but found the concept of transformation is changing the entire dimension to a new dimension,like moving and stretching a 2d sheet to match our end transformation and take the new coordinates of the vector on this sheet.


Day 21:
learning completely about matrices and their use in machine learning,started calculus basics.

Day 22: 
started coding face recognition application,don't want to learn maths for small applications,new plan learn algorithms while building an application then learn maths underneath it,this will be easy

Day 23:
worked on installation of packages,Done with them,got working installation and code.Have to start the face recognition project with a good process flow and design then learn the actual coding for recognition.There are so many ways to do and resources are not good to learn but research only,so have to dig deep.
